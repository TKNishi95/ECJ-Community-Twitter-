# Abstract 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, has been marked as a critical turning point for the bilateral relations between Japan and the European Union. The coordination of sanctions imposed against Russia, along with the increasing overlap in strategic interests between both sides, has caught the attention of European researchers and EU officials to foster deeper alignment with Japan. Additionally, in Japan, the unprecedented war in Ukraine has elevated the public exposure of its domestic academics in EU and European affairs, increasing public consciousness of the EU within Japanese society. Amidst the backdrop, this study aims to investigate the activity and influence of the European Community in Japan (ECJ) (a group representing the EU's Delegation to Japan and Japan's domestic scholars of EU/European issues) so far on the digital sphere, specifically on Twitter, using contemporary methodologies of Social Network Analysis and Topic Modelling via BERTopic. We find that ECJ's activity on Twitter revolves around promoting each user's professional activities, either as diplomatic representatives or academics. In terms of ECJ's influence on Twitter, current results indicate that the accounts are well connected to a diverse network of international political and academic communities, not just constrained to Japan, while also appearing to have a degree of influence within this network.
